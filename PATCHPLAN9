#Plan 9 source can be converted for akaros via a set of scripts.
#This is a WIP. 
# At this point, we take it just so far and do the rest
# by hand. Cocci has its issues, and we're not here to debug
# and fix them all. Also, we may create some post-conversion
# scripts as well. We'll see.
#
#We preserve the waserror/poperror style, which adds complications
#but leaves the source relatively clean.
#
#To convert plan 9 source, we have to do several things.
#We use spatch, the semantic patch tool. BUT, that tool can be
#painful for some stuff, so we also use sed. And in some cases
#we clean up things that we do with spatch with a sed pass.
#Ugly but effective. Some scripts are idempotent, so we mark
#them as such.
