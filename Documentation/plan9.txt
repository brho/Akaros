We're adding the plan 9 file system to akaros.We're bringing in the
name space interface, including the ability to do binds, union mounts,
and the like. We will extend it to support things we might need,
in particular mmap. 

By bringing this model in, we can make the interface more powerful,
and simpler. We can remove 16 system calls right away and yet still have
the functions they provided, for example. 

This is not a from scratch effort but a code translation. The Plan 9 code
deals with very subtle situations and has been hardened over time. No need
to relearn what they learned from scratch.

Currently we have a lot of the code in and are testing a first device -- 
the regression device from NxM.
